## Instructions

To play Zombie Squash download the code and open index.html in Chrome, FireFox, or Edge. (Internet Explorer is not supported)
The arrow keys or wasd keys are used to move the zombie around on the tiles.

##Contributing

Feel free to fork the code and modify to your liking. I may open some issues in the future.
Of course, please credit me (Andrew Rogala at https://github.com/ARogala/Frogger) for my initial work on Zombie Squash.

##GamePlay Rules

You have five (5) lives/hearts, get hit and lose a life!

Each brain the player eats will earn one (1) star.

If you manage to eat six (6) brains before losing all five (5) lives, and before three (3) minutes is up you win!

There are two (2) gems between the zombie and the brain. Collect both gems before you eat a brain and you will
be given an extra brain to eat. YUMMY!!

After eating your brain or brains you will be set back to the beginning to start another quest for brains!
Of course, there will be another two (2) gems to collect along the way.

The arrow keys or wasd keys are used to move the zombie around on the tiles.

The game also has some sound effects and music so turn on your speakers and click the play music button.

Enjoy!

##Future Plans

Add walking animation to the zombie.
Add levels or increase difficultly as player advances.
Give the Zombie the ability to jump over an enemy. (1 or 2 jumps per game)
